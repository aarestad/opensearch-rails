# OpenSearch

[![Ruby 3.2](https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/actions/workflows/3.2.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/actions/workflows/3.2.yml)
[![Ruby 2.7](https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/workflows/Ruby%202.7/badge.svg)](https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/actions)
[![JRuby](https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/workflows/JRuby/badge.svg)](https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/actions)

This repository contains various Ruby and Rails integrations for [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/). This is a fork
of [elasticsearch-rails v7.2.1](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/tree/v7.2.1).

Functionalities include:
* ActiveModel integration with adapters for ActiveRecord and Mongoid
* _Repository pattern_ based persistence layer for Ruby objects
* Enumerable-based wrapper for search results
* ActiveRecord::Relation-based wrapper for returning search results as records
* Convenience model methods such as `search`, `mapping`, `import`, etc
* Rake tasks for importing the data
* Support for Kaminari and WillPaginate pagination
* Integration with Rails' instrumentation framework
* Templates for generating example Rails application

OpenSearch client and Ruby API is provided by the
**[opensearch-ruby](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-ruby)** project.

## Installation

Install each library from [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/opensearch):

    gem install opensearch-model
    gem install opensearch-rails

To use an unreleased version, add it to your `Gemfile` for [Bundler](http://bundler.io):

```ruby
gem 'opensearch-model', github: 'compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails', branch: '5.x'
gem 'opensearch-rails', github: 'compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails', branch: '5.x'
```

## Compatibility

The libraries are compatible with Ruby 2.4 and higher.

We follow Ruby’s own maintenance policy and officially support all currently maintained versions per [Ruby Maintenance Branches](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/).

The version numbers follow the OpenSearch major versions. Currently the `main` branch is compatible with version `2.x` of the OpenSearch stack.

| Rubygem       |   | OpenSearch    |
|:-------------:|:-:| :-----------: |
| main          | → | 2.x           |

## Usage

This project is split into three separate gems:

* [**`opensearch-model`**](https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/tree/main/opensearch-model),
  which contains search integration for Ruby/Rails models such as ActiveRecord::Base and Mongoid,

* [**`opensearch-persistence`**](https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/tree/main/opensearch-persistence),
  which provides a standalone persistence layer for Ruby/Rails objects and models

* [**`opensearch-rails`**](https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/tree/main/opensearch-rails),
  which contains various features for Ruby on Rails applications

Example of a basic integration into an ActiveRecord-based model:

```ruby
require 'opensearch/model'

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  include OpenSearch::Model
  include OpenSearch::Model::Callbacks
end

# Index creation right at import time is not encouraged.
# Typically, you would call create_index! asynchronously (e.g. in a cron job)
# However, we are adding it here so that this usage example can run correctly.
Article.__opensearch__.create_index!
Article.import

@articles = Article.search('foobar').records
```

You can generate a simple Ruby on Rails application with a single command
(see the [other available templates](https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/tree/main/opensearch-rails#rails-application-templates)). You'll need to have an OpenSearch cluster running on your system before generating the app. The easiest way of getting this set up is by running it with Docker with this command:

```bash
  docker run \
    --name opensearch-rails-searchapp \
    --publish 9200:9200 \
    --env "discovery.type=single-node" \
    --env "cluster.name=opensearch-rails" \
    --env "cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled=false" \
    --rm \
    opensearchproject/opensearch:latest
```

Once OpenSearch is running, you can generate the simple app with this command:

```bash
rails new searchapp --skip --skip-bundle --template https://raw.github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails/main/opensearch-rails/lib/rails/templates/01-basic.rb
```

Example of using OpenSearch as a repository for a Ruby domain object:

```ruby
class Article
  attr_accessor :title
end

require 'opensearch/persistence'
repository = OpenSearch::Persistence::Repository.new

repository.save Article.new(title: 'Test')
# POST http://localhost:9200/repository/article
# => {"_index"=>"repository", "_type"=>"article", "_id"=>"Ak75E0U9Q96T5Y999_39NA", ...}
```

## Development

To work on the code, clone the repository and install all dependencies first:

```
git clone https://github.com/compliance-innovations/opensearch-rails.git
cd opensearch-rails/
bundle install
rake bundle:install
```

### Running the Test Suite

You can run unit and integration tests for each sub-project by running the respective Rake tasks in their folders.

You can also unit, integration, or both tests for all sub-projects from the top-level directory:

    rake test:all

The test suite expects an OpenSearch cluster running on port 9250, and **will delete all the data**.
